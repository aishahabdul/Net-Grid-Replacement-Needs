# Net-Grid-Replacement-Needs
Develop a model for net new powerplant build out in the United States. This model should deal with growth in capacity, retirement of old assets, new asset construction timelines, and downtime/reliability reserves. Make your forecast for at least the next 20 years.  
Problem 
From the outside in, the total future energy demand in the system can be roughly estimated, but the net new replacement capacity and timing is not clear today. Using emerging AI Deep Research techniques, please develop a model for net new powerplant build out in the United States. This model should deal with growth in capacity, retirement of old assets, new asset construction timelines, and downtime/reliability reserves. Make your forecast for at least the next 20 years. Your answer should be packaged as an investment strategy from the seat of a large investor. 
Additional Considerations 
1. New new replacement capacity = the amount of annual production that should be built into the grid in order to meet increased overall demand along with replacement of retired assets. 
2. Regional demand analysis: Historical regional energy use data is available. Be sure to describe your logic and method for estimation of any future growth or reduction in the regions you assess. Consider factors such as existing infrastructure age, population trends, industrial base, industrial base change, climate change, and regional policies. 
3. Technology Mix Assessment: What combination of generation technologies (solar, wind, nuclear, natural gas, battery storage, etc.) would optimize for both financial returns and grid reliability? How might this mix evolve over the 20-year forecast period? 
4. Policy and Regulatory Impacts: How might changes in energy policy at federal, state, and local levels affect investment opportunities? Consider scenarios for carbon pricing, renewable portfolio standards, and streamlined permitting. 
5. Supply Chain Constraints: What bottlenecks exist in manufacturing capacity, skilled labor, or raw materials that could impact deployment timelines and costs? How should these be factored into investment strategies? 
6. Risk Assessment: What are the key risks to your investment thesis (technological disruptions, policy reversals, economic shifts, climate impacts)? How would you hedge against these risks in a diversified portfolio approach?
7. Timing Windows: Identify optimal entry and exit points for different types of grid infrastructure investments over the 20-year horizon. Which investments need to be made early vs. which can wait for technology improvements or price declines? 
Deliverables 
Your final investment strategy should include: 
1. A quantitative model forecasting net new power capacity needs by technology type, region, and timeline (years 1-5, 6-10, 11-20) 
2. Visual representation of asset retirement trajectories for existing infrastructure, including geographic distribution and replacement scheduling - this is a key analysis and should draw on actual asset in service dates and expected time to retirement (a small accurate sample with method is better than sweeping generalizations)
3. A detailed analysis of at least 3 high-potential investment categories with: ○ Required capital deployment timelines 
○ Expected ROI ranges under different scenarios 
○ Key risk factors and mitigation strategies 
○ Competitive landscape analysis 
4. At least 2 detailed investment portfolio options for a large investor with $10+ billion in deployable capital, including: 
○ Asset allocation strategies across technology types 
○ Geographic diversification approach 
○ Public vs. private market strategies 
○ Recommended investment vehicles (direct project investment, funds, public equities, etc.) 
5. A "dashboard" design for tracking investment performance, including key metrics and decision points that would trigger portfolio rebalancing
